Requirement of the project about the run_analysis.R that does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Variables from the downloaded file:
x_train
y_train
x_test
y_test
subject_train
subject_test

Variables after merged:
x_data
y_data
subject_data

merged_data combined the variables of x_data,y_data and subject_data

averages_data stored the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
